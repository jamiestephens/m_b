### Project Proposal

#### What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?            


#### Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?


#### What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?


#### What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?


#### If modeling, what will you predict as your target?


#### How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?


#### Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?


#### What would a minimum viable product (MVP) look like for this project?
