### Project Proposal

#### What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?            

What factors carry the greatest weight in determining if loans made through a peer lending service are approved or declined?

#### Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?

This project will be designed as a proposal toward Lending Club, a peer to peer lending service 

#### What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?

Datasets for both accepted and rejected loans will be obtained from a [previous Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club), which was downloaded from LendingClub.com.

#### What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?

An individual sample would be one loan request with information as to loan amount, date it was requested, the occupation of the requester, and other details pertaining to the loan.

#### If modeling, what will you predict as your target?

I'll predict that there are quantifiable trends, such as age or type of employment, that significantly impact if a loan request is approved or denied.

#### How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?

I intend to consolidate the data and perform EDA within Google Sheets, and ultimately aggregate the data and present it using Tableau-generated visualizations.

#### Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?

Potentially will be using Python.

#### What would a minimum viable product (MVP) look like for this project?

A MVP for this project would be a general analysis of 50 records, with some general conclusions as to if any trends exist, as well as visualizations if applicable.
